# Linear Regression from Scratch

## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression from scratch, focusing on predicting car prices based on mileage and model year. The key components include:

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Loading and cleaning the dataset to extract relevant features (`mileage`, `model year`, and `price`).
- Data transformations include handling currency conversion, removing units, and normalizing values.

### 2. Visualization  
- Visualizing relationships between features and prices using 2D and 3D plots to understand trends.

### 3. Linear Regression Implementation  
- **Manual Implementation**: Using a hypothesis function, cost function, and gradient descent optimization to compute optimal weights.  
- **Normalization**: Features are normalized to improve convergence and reduce error.

### 4. Comparison with Libraries  
- Utilizing `sklearn.linear_model` to verify the accuracy of the manual implementation.

### 5. Normal Equation Method  
- Implementing the normal equation for direct computation of weights and verifying results against gradient descent.

### 6. Evaluation  
- Comparing predictions with actual prices and analyzing performance using custom and library-based approaches.

This project highlights foundational concepts in machine learning, emphasizing linear regression theory and practical application.
